There are different types of Clocks:
Wall Clocks,
Watches,
Alarm Clocks, and there is
Big Ben.

Clocks have a lot in common:
they can be set to a time,
can be read,
and they can be fast or slow.
And they can make a sound.

Wall Clocks say “Cuckoo”, Watches say “Tick Tock”, Alarm Clocks say “Buzzz”, and Big Ben says “Big Ben”.

Watches have an extra parameter, color; this can be set only once.

Alarm Clocks have an extra functionality: they can be set to an alarm time and be asked how much time do we have left to sleep.

There exists only one Big Ben in the whole world.

Clocks can measure the passage of time in seconds.
All of them know the actual hour, minute, and second (three int variables).

Every watch can record the passage of time, one second at a time, one tick at a time.

Create a Clock Shop where multiple different clocks are displayed.
Model the passage of time in a main function: each clock ticks one second at a time.
In each second display the state of every clocks state.
In every hour each clock sound (watch out for alarm clocks!)

Hints: you should have an abstract class, use inheritance, data hiding and make sure there is no code repetition
